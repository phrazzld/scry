# Prompt Enhancement: Before & After Comparison

This document shows the key differences between the old counting-based approach and the new atomicity-first approach.

---

## Step 1: Intent Clarification

### BEFORE (Counting-Based)

```markdown
You are an educational strategist translating raw learner input into a clear, actionable study plan.

Produce a natural description that:
- Corrects any obvious wording/term issues in passing.
- Expands shorthand and clarifies intent.
- States the target in your own words, then sketches a compact "study map" at three tiers:
  ‚Ä¢ Foundations: essential terms/facts/conventions
  ‚Ä¢ Applications: problems/tasks they should be able to handle
  ‚Ä¢ Extensions: deeper or adjacent ideas worth knowing if time allows
- Right-size the plan with concrete question counts:
  ‚Ä¢ Single fact (e.g., "capital of France") ‚Üí 2-4 questions
  ‚Ä¢ Small list (e.g., "primary colors" - 3 items) ‚Üí 6-9 questions
  ‚Ä¢ Medium list (e.g., "NATO alphabet" - 26 items) ‚Üí 30-40 questions
  ‚Ä¢ Multiple lists (e.g., "deadly sins + virtues" - 14 items) ‚Üí 20-30 questions
  ‚Ä¢ Broad topic (e.g., "React hooks") ‚Üí 20-35 questions

For enumerable lists: Plan roughly 1-1.5 questions per item (recognition + recall).
For broad topics: Focus on core concepts, common patterns, and key distinctions.

Keep it human and concise (2‚Äì4 short paragraphs).
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Focus on hitting a number range
- ‚ùå No explicit atomic analysis
- ‚ùå Same heuristic for all content types
- ‚ùå No synthesis planning
- ‚ùå Vague guidance for complex content

### AFTER (Atomicity-First)

```markdown
You are an expert educational assessment designer analyzing content for comprehensive mastery testing.

TASK: Identify what someone needs to know to demonstrate mastery of this content.

ATOMIC ANALYSIS - Choose the appropriate approach:

üìã For ENUMERABLE content (poems, lists, prayers, alphabets, sequential passages):
List every discrete element that must be learned.
Examples:
‚Ä¢ "Sonnet 18" ‚Üí Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, ... Line 14 (14 line atoms)
‚Ä¢ "NATO alphabet" ‚Üí A‚ÜíAlfa, B‚ÜíBravo, C‚ÜíCharlie, ... Z‚ÜíZulu (26 pair atoms)
‚Ä¢ "Lord's Prayer" ‚Üí Phrase 1, Phrase 2, ... (N phrase atoms)

üß† For CONCEPTUAL content (theories, systems, skills, frameworks):
Identify the key testable facets of each concept.
Examples:
‚Ä¢ "useState hook" ‚Üí Core atoms: purpose, syntax, return values, re-render rules, constraints, common mistakes (6 facets)
‚Ä¢ "Photosynthesis" ‚Üí Core atoms: definition, location, inputs, outputs, light reactions, Calvin cycle, equation (7 facets)

üîÄ For MIXED content:
Identify both enumerable elements AND conceptual facets.
Example: "React hooks" ‚Üí 8 enumerable hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) √ó 5-6 facets each

SYNTHESIS OPPORTUNITIES:
Beyond individual atoms, what connections/integrations should be tested?
‚Ä¢ Relationships between atoms (how X relates to Y)
‚Ä¢ Sequential/causal dependencies (X must happen before Y)
‚Ä¢ System-level understanding (how parts form the whole)
‚Ä¢ Practical applications (using multiple atoms together)

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
Clearly state:
1. What type of content this is (enumerable/conceptual/mixed)
2. The atomic knowledge units (list them or state the count if large)
3. Synthesis opportunities (key connections to test)
4. Testing strategy: How many questions per atom? How many synthesis questions?
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit atomic analysis framework
- ‚úÖ Content-type classification
- ‚úÖ Clear enumeration for poems/lists
- ‚úÖ Facet identification for concepts
- ‚úÖ Synthesis planning
- ‚úÖ Testing strategy based on atom types

## Step 2: Question Generation

### BEFORE (Counting-Based)

```markdown
You are a master tutor creating a practice set directly from this goal:

---
${clarifiedIntent}
---

Produce a set of questions that, if mastered, would make the learner confident they've covered what matters.

CRITICAL COUNTING GUIDANCE:
First, count what needs coverage. Then generate questions.

Aim for roughly 1-1.5 questions per item for enumerable lists.
Quality over quantity - focused coverage beats exhaustive repetition.

Examples:
‚Ä¢ "Primary colors" (3 items) ‚Üí 6-9 questions
‚Ä¢ "NATO alphabet" (26 letters) ‚Üí 30-40 questions
‚Ä¢ "Deadly sins + heavenly virtues" (14 items) ‚Üí 20-30 questions
‚Ä¢ "React hooks" (~10 core hooks) ‚Üí 20-35 questions

For enumerable lists, vary question types:
- Recognition: "Which of these is X?"
- Recall: "What is the X for Y?"
- Application: "Which X applies here?"
- Contrast: "How does X differ from Y?"

Vary form with purpose:
  ‚Ä¢ Multiple-choice (exactly 4 options) when you can write distinct, plausible distractors
  ‚Ä¢ True/False (exactly "True","False") for crisp claims or quick interleaving checks.
- Order items so the learner warms up, then stretches.
- For every item, include a short teaching explanation

Return only the questions, answers, and explanations (no extra commentary).
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Still focused on hitting number ranges
- ‚ùå No explicit coverage verification
- ‚ùå Unclear how to handle complex concepts
- ‚ùå No synthesis requirement
- ‚ùå Question types mixed with counting guidance

### AFTER (Atomicity-First)

```markdown
You are a master tutor creating a comprehensive mastery assessment.

ANALYSIS FROM STEP 1:
---
${clarifiedIntent}
---

The analysis identified atomic knowledge units and synthesis opportunities.

YOUR TASK: Generate questions ensuring EVERY atom is thoroughly tested.

GENERATION STRATEGY:

1Ô∏è‚É£ ATOMIC QUESTIONS - For each atom identified:

üìã Discrete atoms (lines, items, list elements, facts):
‚Üí Generate 1-2 questions per atom (recognition + recall)
‚Üí Examples:
  ‚Ä¢ Line testing: "What comes after [line N]?" + "What is line [N+1]?"
  ‚Ä¢ List items: "What letter is Charlie?" + "What is C in NATO alphabet?"
  ‚Ä¢ Facts: "What is X?" + "Which of these is X?"

üß† Conceptual atoms (ideas, mechanisms, principles, facets):
‚Üí Generate 2-4 questions per atom (test from multiple angles)
‚Üí Examples:
  ‚Ä¢ Understanding: "What does X do?"
  ‚Ä¢ Application: "When would you use X?"
  ‚Ä¢ Edge cases: "What happens if X in situation Y?"
  ‚Ä¢ Common mistakes: "Why is Z wrong when using X?"

Test each atom from different angles:
- Recall: "What is X?"
- Recognition: "Which is X?"
- Application: "How/when to use X?"
- Analysis: "Why does X work this way?"
- Comparison: "How does X differ from Y?"

2Ô∏è‚É£ SYNTHESIS QUESTIONS (15-20% of total):
For the connections/integrations identified in the analysis:
‚Üí Integration: "How does atom A connect to atom B?"
‚Üí Sequential: "What's the relationship between X and Y?"
‚Üí Application: "Apply atoms X, Y, Z together to solve..."
‚Üí System-level: "How do the parts form the whole?"
‚Üí Comparison: "Compare and contrast X and Y"

COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS:
‚úì Every atom from the analysis has questions
‚úì Atoms tested from appropriate angles (1-2 for discrete, 2-4 for concepts)
‚úì Synthesis questions included (15-20% of total)
‚úì No redundancy - same knowledge tested from different angles is good, identical questions is bad
‚úì No gaps - every atom must be covered

QUESTION QUALITY:
- Multiple-choice: Exactly 4 options with distinct, plausible distractors reflecting real confusions
- True/False: Exactly 2 options ["True", "False"] for crisp, unambiguous claims
- Order questions from simpler to more complex (warm up, then stretch)
- Every question includes explanation addressing: why correct, why wrong options are wrong, common misconception to avoid

FINAL CHECK:
Could someone answer all these questions correctly yet still lack mastery?
- If YES: You have gaps, add missing questions
- If NO: Coverage is complete

Generate the questions now. Return only the questions array (no extra commentary).
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ References Step 1 atomic analysis
- ‚úÖ Clear generation strategy per atom type
- ‚úÖ Explicit synthesis requirement (15-20%)
- ‚úÖ Coverage checklist
- ‚úÖ Quality verification gate
- ‚úÖ Multiple testing angles per atom
- ‚úÖ No arbitrary number targets

## Example Output Comparison

### Input: "Memorize Shakespeare's Sonnet 18"

#### BEFORE (Counting-Based Step 1 Output)

```
The learner wants to memorize Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, a 14-line poem.

Foundations: The 14 lines of the sonnet, basic vocabulary and phrasing.
Applications: Ability to recite the sonnet from memory, understand the metaphors.
Extensions: Understanding of Shakespearean sonnet structure, literary devices used.

For a 14-line poem, we should plan roughly 1-1.5 questions per line for memorization:
14 lines √ó 1.5 = 21 questions, plus a few for structure and theme = 20-28 questions total.

This should provide comprehensive coverage of the sonnet for memorization purposes.
```

**Issues:**
- ‚úì Gets to ~20-28 questions (decent)
- ‚ùå No atomic enumeration
- ‚ùå Vague on testing strategy
- ‚ùå No synthesis planning

#### AFTER (Atomicity-First Step 1 Output)

```
Content Type: ENUMERABLE (poem with sequential lines)

Atomic knowledge units:
üìã Sequential atoms (14 line atoms):
- Line 1: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"
- Line 2: "Thou art more lovely and more temperate:"
- Line 3: "Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,"
[... lines 4-14 ...]

üß† Structural/conceptual atoms:
- Rhyme scheme (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG)
- Sonnet structure (3 quatrains + couplet)
- Central metaphor (comparison to summer)
- Volta/turn (shift at line 9: "But thy eternal summer...")
- Theme (eternal beauty through poetry)

Synthesis opportunities:
- How the quatrains build the argument
- Relationship between volta and conclusion
- How rhyme scheme reinforces structure
- Connection between metaphor and theme

Testing strategy:
- 14 line atoms √ó 1.5-2 questions = 21-28 line questions
  ‚Ä¢ Line completion: "What comes after...?"
  ‚Ä¢ Line recall: "What is line N?"
  ‚Ä¢ Location: "Which line contains...?"
- 5-7 structural/conceptual questions
- 3-4 synthesis questions (argument flow, thematic unity)

Total: 29-39 questions for comprehensive mastery
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit line enumeration
- ‚úÖ Structural concepts identified
- ‚úÖ Clear synthesis opportunities
- ‚úÖ Detailed testing strategy
- ‚úÖ Higher question count (more thorough)

---

### Input: "Teach me React hooks"

#### BEFORE (Counting-Based Step 1 Output)

```
The learner wants to understand React hooks, the modern way to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

Foundations: Core hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext), basic syntax and usage.
Applications: Using hooks to manage state, handle side effects, access context in real components.
Extensions: Advanced hooks (useReducer, useCallback, useMemo, useRef), custom hooks, best practices.

React has roughly 10 core hooks. At 2-3.5 questions per hook:
10 hooks √ó 3 = 30 questions, plus integration and patterns = 30-40 questions total.

This covers the essential hooks comprehensively.
```

**Issues:**
- ‚úì Reasonable estimate (30-40)
- ‚ùå Doesn't identify facets per hook
- ‚ùå Vague on "integration and patterns"
- ‚ùå Treats all hooks as equal complexity

#### AFTER (Atomicity-First Step 1 Output)

```
Content Type: MIXED (8 enumerable hooks, each with multiple conceptual facets)

Atomic knowledge units:
üîÄ Enumerable hooks (8 core hooks):
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext
4. useReducer
5. useCallback
6. useMemo
7. useRef
8. Custom hooks

üß† Conceptual facets per hook (example: useState):
- Purpose: Managing state in function components
- Syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)
- Return values: [current state, updater function]
- Re-render behavior: Calling setState triggers re-render
- Functional updates: setState(prev => prev + 1)
- Constraints: Must be called at top level, same order every render
- Common mistakes: Mutating state directly, closure issues

Similar facets for each hook (5-7 facets each).

Synthesis opportunities:
- When to use useState vs useReducer
- useEffect + useContext patterns
- useCallback + useMemo performance optimization
- Rules of hooks (why they exist, how to follow them)
- Custom hook composition patterns
- Common anti-patterns across hooks

Testing strategy:
- 8 hooks √ó 4-5 facet questions = 32-40 hook-specific questions
  ‚Ä¢ Purpose: "What does X do?"
  ‚Ä¢ Syntax: "What does X return?"
  ‚Ä¢ Behavior: "When does X trigger re-render?"
  ‚Ä¢ Edge cases: "What happens if...?"
  ‚Ä¢ Mistakes: "Why is this wrong?"
- 6-8 synthesis questions
  ‚Ä¢ Hook selection: "When to use X vs Y?"
  ‚Ä¢ Composition: "How to combine X and Y?"
  ‚Ä¢ Rules: "Why must hooks be at top level?"
  ‚Ä¢ Patterns: "What's the data fetching pattern?"

Total: 38-48 questions for comprehensive mastery
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Each hook enumerated
- ‚úÖ Facets identified (7 per hook)
- ‚úÖ Specific synthesis opportunities
- ‚úÖ Question types per facet
- ‚úÖ More thorough coverage
