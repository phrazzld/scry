# Strategic Implementation Planner - Multi-Expert Analysis for Scry

Create comprehensive implementation plans for Scry features using legendary programmer perspectives and thorough research.

**Usage**: `/project:plan`

## GOAL

Generate the best possible implementation plan for the task described in TASK.md by:
- Conducting exhaustive research and context gathering specific to spaced repetition learning systems
- Leveraging multiple expert programming personas through subagents, including domain experts in React, Next.js, and AI/ML
- Synthesizing diverse perspectives into a strongly opinionated recommendation aligned with Scry's vision

## ANALYZE

Your job is to make the best possible implementation plan for the task described in TASK.md.

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
1. Read TASK.md thoroughly to understand requirements and constraints
2. Comb through the codebase to collect relevant context and patterns, particularly:
   - Next.js 15 App Router patterns and conventions
   - React 19 features and best practices
   - shadcn/ui component patterns
   - TypeScript strict mode considerations
3. Read relevant leyline documents in `./docs/leyline/` for foundational principles, especially:
   - Tenets related to simplicity, testability, and user-centricity
   - TypeScript-specific bindings for modern patterns
   - Web accessibility guidelines
4. Use context7 MCP server to research:
   - Next.js 15 documentation and best practices
   - React 19 patterns and performance optimization
   - Spaced repetition algorithms and learning psychology
   - LLM integration patterns for content generation
5. Conduct web searches on:
   - Spaced repetition implementation strategies
   - Background job architectures for Next.js
   - Notification system patterns for web apps
   - AI-powered content generation best practices

### Phase 2: Multi-Expert Analysis
Launch parallel subagents embodying legendary programmer perspectives using the Task tool. Use them to thoroughly review, investigate, audit, and analyze the code, but do not have them write any code! They should output everything to chat, and they should not use plan mode.

**Task 1: John Carmack Perspective**
- Prompt: "As John Carmack, analyze this task focusing on performance optimization, elegant algorithms, and first principles thinking. For Scry's spaced repetition system, what would be the most algorithmically sound approach? Consider memory efficiency for large content sets, optimal scheduling algorithms, and responsive UI performance in a Next.js environment."

**Task 2: Dan Abramov Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Dan Abramov, analyze this task from React architecture and state management perspectives. How would you structure React components and state for Scry's quiz system? Consider React 19 features, server components vs client components, optimal data fetching patterns, and maintaining UI responsiveness during background content generation."

**Task 3: Guillermo Rauch Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Guillermo Rauch, analyze this task focusing on Next.js best practices, edge computing, and optimal deployment strategies. How would you architect Scry to leverage Next.js 15's capabilities? Consider API routes, middleware, background jobs, caching strategies, and Vercel deployment optimization."

**Task 4: Jeff Dean Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Jeff Dean, analyze this task from distributed systems and scalability perspectives. How would you design Scry's background job system for LLM content generation to handle thousands of users? Consider queue management, rate limiting, failover strategies, and efficient storage of generated content."

**Task 5: Andrew Ng Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Andrew Ng, analyze this task from AI/ML and learning optimization perspectives. How would you design the LLM integration for generating effective study content? Consider prompt engineering, content quality validation, personalization strategies, and optimizing for actual learning outcomes."

**Task 6: Bret Taylor Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Bret Taylor, analyze this task focusing on product-focused engineering and user experience. What approach would create the most frictionless learning experience while being practically implementable? Consider onboarding flows, engagement patterns, and features that actually drive user retention."

### Phase 3: Design Exploration
For each approach, consider:
- **Simplest solutions**: MVP approaches that deliver core value quickly
- **Complex solutions**: Comprehensive implementations with advanced features
- **Creative solutions**: Innovative approaches leveraging cutting-edge Next.js/React features
- **Hybrid approaches**: Pragmatic combinations balancing innovation with reliability

Specific considerations for Scry:
- **Content Generation**: Synchronous vs asynchronous, queue architectures, LLM provider strategies
- **Quiz Engine**: State management, progress tracking, algorithm implementation
- **Data Persistence**: Database choices, caching strategies, offline capabilities
- **User Experience**: Loading states, progressive enhancement, mobile optimization
- **Notifications**: Web push, email, in-app patterns

## EXECUTE
