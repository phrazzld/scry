# Generation Modal Test Plan

## Test Summary
All automated tests pass. The generation modal feature is ready for manual testing.

## Automated Test Results âœ…
- **ESLint**: No warnings or errors
- **TypeScript**: Compilation successful
- **Production Build**: Builds in 3.0s with proper code splitting
- **Bundle Size**: 227 kB shared JS (acceptable)

## Manual Testing Checklist

### 1. Generation Modal Access
- [ ] Click sparkles button in header (left of user menu)
- [ ] Press 'G' key anywhere on the page (when not typing)
- [ ] Modal opens smoothly with animation
- [ ] Modal is centered and responsive

### 2. Basic Generation Flow
- [ ] Type "JavaScript closures" in the prompt field
- [ ] Textarea auto-resizes as you type
- [ ] Cancel button closes modal
- [ ] Generate button submits form
- [ ] Loading spinner appears during generation
- [ ] Success toast shows on completion
- [ ] Modal closes automatically after success
- [ ] New questions appear in review (within 30s polling)

### 3. Context-Aware Generation
- [ ] Open modal while viewing a question
- [ ] "Start from current question" checkbox appears
- [ ] Check the checkbox
- [ ] Current question preview shows (truncated to 50 chars)
- [ ] Type "but with practical examples"
- [ ] Submit generates related questions

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Submit empty prompt shows error toast
- [ ] Network errors show appropriate error message
- [ ] Modal remains open on error for retry

### 5. Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] ESC key closes the modal
- [ ] Tab navigation works through form elements
- [ ] Enter submits form when button is focused

### 6. Authentication State
- [ ] Modal only opens when authenticated
- [ ] SessionToken is included in API request
- [ ] User metrics are passed (currently placeholder values)

## Integration Points

### Components
- `GenerationModal` - Main modal component
- `MinimalHeader` - Contains generate button and modal instance
- `use-keyboard-shortcuts` - Handles 'G' key shortcut

### API
- `/api/generate-quiz` - Endpoint for quiz generation
- Expects: `{ topic, difficulty, sessionToken, userContext }`
- Returns: Generated questions saved to Convex

## Known Limitations
- User performance metrics use placeholder values (75% success rate, 30s average)
- Full implementation would require new Convex query for actual metrics

## Next Steps
1. Run `pnpm dev` to start development server
2. Run `npx convex dev` in separate terminal for backend
3. Complete manual testing checklist above
4. Verify in both desktop and mobile viewports
