# TODO

## Ship Fullscreen Immersive Sign-In

### Hide Navbar for Unauthenticated Users
- [x] Add `useAuth()` to `components/conditional-navbar.tsx`
- [x] Return `null` when `pathname === '/' && !user && !isLoading`
- [x] Keep navbar visible on `/auth/verify` regardless of auth

### Transform Layout to Left-Aligned Grid
- [x] Remove `items-center justify-center` from `components/sign-in-landing.tsx` root div
- [x] Remove `pt-20` padding (no navbar = no offset)
- [x] Delete `max-w-md` container
- [x] Replace flex with CSS Grid: `grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr`
- [x] Position content in middle column

### Implement Typography Hierarchy  
- [x] Delete duplicate "Scry" h1 from SignInLanding
- [x] Add small "SCRY" wordmark at top-left: `text-xs tracking-[0.2em] text-gray-600 font-mono`
- [x] Create two-line headline: "Master any topic." + "Remember everything."
- [x] Use `font-serif text-5xl leading-none` for headlines
- [x] Add caption below: "AI-powered spaced repetition" in `text-sm text-gray-600`
- [x] Mobile: reduce headline to `text-3xl`

### Simplify Form to Underline Input
- [x] Remove Card/CardContent wrapper from form
- [x] Style input: `border-0 border-b border-gray-300 bg-transparent px-0 py-3 text-lg`
- [x] Add focus state: `focus:border-gray-900 focus:border-b-2`
- [x] Remove "Get started" heading
- [x] Remove "Enter your email" description
- [x] Inline submit button next to input (same row)

### Add Subtle Background Animation
- [x] Add to `app/globals.css`:
```css
@keyframes gradient-shift {
  0%, 100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  50% { background-position: 100% 50%; }
}
.gradient-bg {
  background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #f0f0f0, #ffffff, #f8f8f8, #ffffff);
  background-size: 400% 400%;
  animation: gradient-shift 20s ease infinite;
}
```
- [x] Apply `.gradient-bg` to SignInLanding root
- [x] Add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` to disable animation

### Implement Fade-In Sequence
- [x] Add opacity-0 to all content elements initially
- [x] Use `transition-opacity duration-500` on each element
- [x] Stagger with delays: wordmark (0ms), headline (200ms), input (400ms)
- [x] Trigger with `useEffect` on mount

### Simplify Success State
- [x] Keep same layout when email sent
- [x] Replace form with: "Check your email" + email in monospace
- [x] Single text link: "Use different email" (no buttons)
- [x] Remove checkmark icon

### Remove Clutter
- [x] Delete all three feature cards (Smart Learning, etc.)
- [x] Remove footer from unauthenticated homepage
- [x] Delete "By signing in..." legal text

### Mobile Optimization
- [x] At `<768px`: single column, 20px padding
- [x] Ensure input is minimum 44px tall for touch
- [x] Stack button below input on mobile
- [ ] Test that keyboard doesn't cause viewport jump

### Polish
- [x] Auto-focus email input after fade-in completes
- [x] Add `enterkeyhint="go"` to input
- [x] Ensure Tab key works correctly
- [x] Add `aria-label` to form elements
- [ ] Test loading state doesn't cause layout shift

- [ ] Create ticket for rewrite after merge
