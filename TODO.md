# TODO: Smart Review Interleaving + Topic Field Removal

## Status: üü¢ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (1 validation task remaining)

**Completed**: 8/9 tasks | **Commits**: 3 | **Tests**: 421 passing ‚úÖ

### What's Done
- ‚úÖ Top-10 Fisher-Yates shuffle implemented in getNextReview query
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (5 tests validating shuffle behavior)
- ‚úÖ Topic field removed from questions schema (breaking change)
- ‚úÖ Migration created (removeTopicFromQuestions with dry-run support)
- ‚úÖ All backend mutations updated (questionsCrud, aiGeneration, questionsLibrary)
- ‚úÖ All frontend components updated (types, hooks, modals, tables)
- ‚úÖ Test fixtures cleaned up (421 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation, linting, and pre-commit hooks passing

### What's Remaining
- ‚è≥ Manual validation: Deploy to dev and verify interleaving behavior with 40+40 questions

### Key Commits
- `ed2ea7d`: Add comprehensive tests for top-10 shuffle behavior
- `e7ea729`: Implement smart review interleaving and remove topic field (20 files changed)
- `18286d3`: Add migration to remove topic field from existing questions

## Context
- **Approach**: Top-10 retrievability shuffle (Fisher-Yates) + complete topic field removal
- **Key Pattern**: Follow existing test patterns in `spacedRepetition.test.ts` (vitest + mock functions)
- **Module Boundary**: Review queue module owns prioritization + dispersion logic; schema module owns minimal question structure
- **Test Commands**: `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:contract`, `pnpm lint`

## Phase 1: Core Interleaving Logic ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Backend: Review Queue Shuffle

- [x] Implement top-10 shuffle in getNextReview query
  ```
  COMPLETED: convex/spacedRepetition.ts:286-302
  - Implemented Fisher-Yates shuffle on top 10 candidates
  - Added after existing retrievability sort
  - Zero deviation from FSRS outside top-N
  Commit: ed2ea7d + e7ea729

  - Test 2: Boundary enforcement (#11-15 never returned)
  - Test 3: FSRS priority respect (within-band shuffle only)
  - Test 4: Edge cases (empty, single, <10 items)
  - Test 5: Shuffle distribution (uniform randomness)
  All 421 tests passing ‚úÖ

  ```

- [ ] Manual validation: Interleaving behavior (PENDING DEPLOYMENT)
  ```
  Status: Ready for testing, requires running dev environment
  Approach:
    1. Deploy schema changes to dev: `pnpm dev` (starts Convex + Next.js)
    2. Run migration: Call api.migrations.removeTopicFromQuestions via Convex dashboard
    3. Generate 40 questions with one prompt (e.g., "React hooks")
    4. Generate 40 questions with different prompt (e.g., "Python asyncio")
    5. Navigate to /review
    6. Observe first 10-20 questions for temporal dispersion
  Success Criteria:
    - Questions generated at similar times are NOT all shown consecutively
    - First 20 questions show mix of both generation batches
    - Shuffle variance observable (different question order on refresh)
  Note: This validates the top-10 shuffle prevents temporal clustering
  ```

## Design Iteration Checkpoints

**After Phase 1 (Shuffle Implementation)**:
- Review: Is top-10 the right N? Measure actual retrievability variance in logs
- Adjust: If variance >0.15 consistently, reduce to top-5; if <0.05, increase to top-15

**After Phase 2 (Topic Removal)**:
- Review: Any frontend features broken by topic removal? Check usage analytics
- Extract: If topic filtering was high-usage, plan tags system as separate feature (add to BACKLOG.md)

**After Phase 3 (Integration)**:
- Review: Query performance unchanged? Check Convex dashboard metrics (<50ms p95 latency)
- Measure: Run manual validation, document actual interleaving ratio (target: 40-60% split)

## Module Boundaries Summary

**Review Queue Module** (`spacedRepetition.ts`):
- **Owns**: FSRS priority calculation, top-N shuffle logic, candidate batching
- **Hides**: Retrievability calculation, shuffle algorithm, batch size constant (N=10)
- **Interface**: `getNextReview() ‚Üí Question | null` (simple, stable)
- **Value**: High functionality (FSRS + interleaving) - Low interface complexity = Deep module ‚úÖ

**Schema Module** (`schema.ts`):
- **Owns**: Question document structure, index definitions
- **Hides**: FSRS internal fields, denormalized counters
- **Interface**: Question type (minimal required fields)
- **Value**: Removes unused complexity (topic field) = Simpler system ‚úÖ

**Migration Module** (`migrations.ts`):
- **Owns**: One-time data transformations, batched processing
- **Hides**: Batch size, retry logic, progress tracking
- **Interface**: Internal mutations (not exposed to frontend)
- **Value**: Safe schema evolution without downtime ‚úÖ

## Risk Mitigation Notes

**Risk: Top-10 shows less urgent item**
- Mitigation: Acceptable by design (all within 0.10 retrievability variance)
- Validation: Post-launch analytics to measure actual variance

**Risk: Users relied on topic filtering**
- Mitigation: Check Convex function logs for `getUserQuestions({ topic: ... })` call frequency
- Contingency: If >20% usage, add tags system to BACKLOG.md as future enhancement

**Risk: Migration fails on large dataset**
- Mitigation: Batched processing (100 items/batch), tested on staging first
- Rollback: Field is optional - no breaking change if migration incomplete

## Automation Opportunities

**Topic field removal pattern** (applied 8 times):
```bash
# Could script this for future schema cleanups
find . -name "*.test.ts" -exec sed -i '' '/topic: /d' {} \;
```

**Test fixture generation**: Consider codegen for mock questions (reduces manual maintenance)

---

**Original Estimate**: 5-6 hours (Phase 1: 1.25h, Phase 2: 3h, Phase 3: 0.5h, Buffer: 0.25-1.25h)
**Actual Time**: ~3 hours implementation (Phase 1: 45min, Phase 2: 2h, Phase 3: 15min automated validation)
**Efficiency Gain**: 50% faster due to systematic sed usage for batch cleanup + existing migration patterns
