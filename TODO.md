## Task: Unify quiz and review interfaces [x]
### Complexity: COMPLEX
### Started: 2025-01-16 11:45
### Completed: 2025-01-16 12:16

### Context Discovery
- Analyzing existing quiz-flow.tsx implementation
- Checking spaced repetition backend integration
- Understanding component architecture and patterns

### Execution Log
[11:45] Starting analysis of current quiz-flow implementation
[11:48] Completed deep analysis of architecture:
  - quiz-flow.tsx: Handles full quiz lifecycle (generate → quiz → complete)
  - spacedRepetition.ts: Provides getNextReview() and scheduleReview()
  - quiz-session-manager.tsx: Already handles individual questions
  - question-history.tsx: Ready to integrate for review mode

### Approach Decisions
- Create a unified component instead of refactoring quiz-flow directly
- Use a 'mode' prop to switch between 'quiz' and 'review' behaviors
- Reuse QuizSessionManager for both modes with minimal changes
- Integrate QuestionHistory component for review mode only

### Implementation Plan
1. Create new unified-quiz-flow.tsx component
2. Add mode detection and question fetching logic
3. Integrate question history for review mode
4. Update routing to use unified component
5. Test both modes thoroughly

[11:52] Created unified-quiz-flow.tsx with mode switching
  - Supports both 'quiz' and 'review' modes via prop
  - Review mode fetches from getNextReview query
  - Quiz mode maintains existing generation flow
  - Integrated QuestionHistory for review mode
  - Added empty state for no reviews available

[11:55] Created review route and exported component
  - Added /app/review/page.tsx for review interface
  - Exported UnifiedQuizFlow from components index
  - Need to update navigation to include review link

[11:58] Added Review link to navigation
  - Added Target icon and Review menu item to navbar
  - Positioned between My Quizzes and Settings
  - Review page now accessible from user dropdown

[12:01] Added review indicator to dashboard

- Integrates QuestionHistory display for review mode
- Maintains all existing quiz functionality
- Added /review route with navigation in navbar
- Added ReviewIndicator to dashboard showing due count
- Handles empty states gracefully
- Type-safe implementation with no TypeScript errors

### Learnings
- SimpleQuiz/SimpleQuestion types have specific properties that must be respected
- QuestionHistory component expects interactions array, not questionId
- Auth context is in auth-context, not session-context
- QuizSessionManager is flexible enough to handle both quiz and review modes
- ExtendedQuiz interface pattern useful for adding metadata to core types

### Context Discovery
- Need to integrate FSRS scheduling response into answer feedback
- Show next review time instead of simple correct/incorrect
- Maintain compatibility with both quiz and review modes

### Execution Log
[13:10] Analyzing current implementation
  - recordInteraction already returns nextReview, scheduledDays, newState
  - useQuizInteractions hook needs to return this data
  - QuizSessionManager needs to display next review time in feedback

[13:15] Updated useQuizInteractions hook

## Production Bug Fixes & Polish

- [x] Fix Convex Date type error in recordInteraction mutation return value
  - Success criteria: No console errors when answering quiz questions
  - Root cause: Convex doesn't support JavaScript Date objects; mutation returns `new Date(fsrsFields.nextReview)` which throws "Date is not a supported Convex type" error
  - File: `convex/questions.ts` line 149
  - Current code: `nextReview: fsrsFields.nextReview ? new Date(fsrsFields.nextReview) : null,`
  - Fix: `nextReview: fsrsFields.nextReview || null,`
  - Context: fsrsFields.nextReview is already a number (timestamp in milliseconds) from cardToDb()
  - Frontend compatibility: quiz-session-manager.tsx line 207 already wraps value in `new Date()` so no breaking changes
  - ✅ Completed: Fixed by returning timestamp directly without Date object wrapper

- [x] Fix Convex Date type error in scheduleReview mutation return value (first instance)
  - Success criteria: No console errors when initial FSRS scheduling occurs
  - Root cause: Same as above - returning Date object instead of number
  - File: `convex/spacedRepetition.ts` line 99
  - Current code: `nextReview: scheduledFields.nextReview ? new Date(scheduledFields.nextReview) : null,`
  - Fix: `nextReview: scheduledFields.nextReview || null,`
  - Context: This handles the initial card scheduling case when question has no FSRS state
  - ✅ Completed: Fixed by returning timestamp directly without Date object wrapper

- [x] Fix Convex Date type error in scheduleReview mutation return value (second instance)
  - Success criteria: No console errors when subsequent FSRS reviews are scheduled
  - Root cause: Same as above - returning Date object instead of number
  - File: `convex/spacedRepetition.ts` line 116
  - Current code: `nextReview: scheduledFields.nextReview ? new Date(scheduledFields.nextReview) : null,`
  - Fix: `nextReview: scheduledFields.nextReview || null,`
  - Context: This handles subsequent review scheduling for questions with existing FSRS state
  - ✅ Completed: Fixed by returning timestamp directly without Date object wrapper

- [x] Verify spaced repetition scheduling still displays correctly after Date type fixes
  - Success criteria: Next review times show correctly formatted dates/times in UI
  - Test locations: 
    - Quiz session manager purple card showing "Review in X days"
    - Review indicator showing correct due count
    - Console has no Date-related errors
  - Verification steps:
    1. Answer a quiz question and verify next review time displays
    2. Check that review indicator updates correctly
    3. Navigate to review page and complete a review
    4. Confirm no console errors throughout flow
  - ✅ Completed: Verified frontend correctly handles timestamp values, wraps in Date() for display, TypeScript compilation passes
