# TODO: PR #32 Review Feedback - Pre-Merge Critical Fix

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL (Merge-Blocking) - NEW ISSUE

### Fix Broken Internal Mutation Reference

**Issue**: `convex/aiGeneration.ts:340` calls `internal.questions.saveBatch` but `questions.ts` was deleted in the refactor. This will cause runtime failure: "No such function: questions.saveBatch"

**Why this matters**: Breaks core feature (AI question generation). Users won't be able to generate new questions.

**Source**: Codex inline review comment (2025-10-10)

**Implementation Steps**:

- [ ] **Update mutation reference** (1min)
  ```
  File: convex/aiGeneration.ts:340
  Change: internal.questions.saveBatch â†’ internal.questionsCrud.saveBatch
  ```

- [ ] **Verify TypeScript compilation** (1min)
  ```
  Run: pnpm build
  Expected: Successful compilation
  ```

- [ ] **Verify Convex API types** (1min)
  ```
  Check: convex/_generated/api.d.ts includes questionsCrud module
  Verify: internal.questionsCrud.saveBatch exists
  ```

- [ ] **Run test suite** (2min)
  ```
  Run: pnpm test
  Expected: 358/358 tests passing
  ```

- [ ] **Commit fix** (1min)
  ```
  Message: "fix: update saveBatch reference to questionsCrud module"
  ```

**Success Criteria**:
- TypeScript compilation successful
- All 358 tests passing
- AI question generation works end-to-end

**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes
