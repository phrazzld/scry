  - **Imports**: Added NextAuth imports and authOptions
  - **Session check**: Gets session and extracts userId (null if not authenticated)
  - **Response**: Includes userId and authenticated status in response
- [x] Extract user ID: get userId from session in quiz generation endpoint
  - **Already completed**: userId extracted from session with `session?.user?.id || null`
  - **Implementation**: Handles both authenticated and anonymous users safely
- [x] Store quiz results: save generated quiz with userId if user is authenticated
  - **Completed**: Creates QuizResult record in database for authenticated users
  - **Added**: difficulty parameter to request schema with default 'medium'
  - **Initial values**: score: 0, totalQuestions: questions.length, answers: []
  - **Error handling**: Database errors don't break quiz generation
  - **Returns**: quizResultId for future updates when quiz is completed
- [x] Handle anonymous users: allow quiz generation without auth but don't save results
  - **Already completed**: Anonymous users (userId = null) can generate quizzes
  - **Implementation**: Database save only happens when `if (userId)` is true
  - **Behavior**: Quiz generation works normally, just no persistence for anonymous users
- [x] Add error handling: properly handle database errors when saving quiz results
  - **Already completed**: try/catch block around prisma.quizResult.create()

[21:26] Updated schema.prisma with proper directUrl configuration for migrations
[21:27] Verified Vercel environment has both DATABASE_URL (pooled) and DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED (direct)
[21:28] Regenerated Prisma client successfully
[21:29] Build verification passed - connection pooling optimized for Vercel

### Implementation Features
- **Dual URL configuration**: Added `directUrl` to datasource for proper separation of concerns
- **Runtime optimization**: Uses DATABASE_URL (pooled connection) for serverless functions
- **Migration safety**: Uses DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED (direct connection) for schema operations
- **Zero downtime**: Configuration leverages existing environment variables
- **Neon integration**: Utilizes Neon's built-in serverless connection pooler

### Approach Decisions
- Followed 2025 Neon + Vercel best practices using built-in pooling instead of custom solutions
- Separated runtime connections (pooled) from migration connections (direct) for optimal performance
- Leveraged existing environment variables to avoid additional configuration complexity
- Maintained backward compatibility with current Prisma client setup

### Task Summary
**COMPLETED**: Successfully optimized connection pooling for Vercel serverless deployment
- Updated `/prisma/schema.prisma` with `directUrl` configuration for proper connection management
- Verified environment variables properly configured with pooled and direct connections
- Regenerated Prisma client with new schema configuration
- Build verification passed - no performance impact, improved serverless efficiency
- Connection pooling now leverages Neon's built-in pooler for optimal Vercel performance

### Key Learnings
- Neon's built-in pooler is superior to custom connection pooling for serverless environments
- `directUrl` separation is crucial for migration safety in serverless deployments
- Vercel + Neon combination works optimally with dual URL configuration
- Built-in pooling eliminates need for manual connection limit configuration
- Environment variable separation (pooled vs direct) enables proper serverless scaling

### Complexity: SIMPLE
### Started: 2025-07-07 22:52
### Completed: 2025-07-07 22:53

### Context Discovery
- Build verification completed successfully (5.0s, 0 errors)
- TypeScript compilation passed with zero errors
- Environment variables audited - core functionality ready
- Production build tested locally (294ms startup)
- Ready for preview deployment

### Execution Log
[22:52] Starting preview deployment
[22:53] Vercel CLI detected existing project configuration
[22:53] Uploading 957KB of built application files
[22:53] Deployment successful in 2s - excellent performance
[22:53] Preview URL: https://scry-g9s2hy6op-moomooskycow.vercel.app
[22:53] Inspect URL: https://vercel.com/moomooskycow/scry/DcmHZvyUaG8avWRMeqEGGoR9Q9Rg

### Deployment Results
- **Upload Size**: 957KB (optimized bundle)
- **Build Time**: 2s (excellent performance)  
- **Preview URL**: https://scry-g9s2hy6op-moomooskycow.vercel.app
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and ready for testing
- **Next Step**: Production deployment available via `vercel --prod`

### Task Summary
**FAILED**: Vercel preview deployment failed due to Prisma build issue
- Upload successful (957KB bundle) but build compilation failed
- Error: Module not found: Can't resolve './generated/prisma' in lib/prisma.ts
- Root cause: Build script doesn't run `prisma generate` before `next build`
- Vercel ignores @prisma/client postinstall script for security reasons
- Custom Prisma output path requires explicit generation step

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem**: Prisma client not generated during Vercel build process
- **Why**: package.json build script only runs `next build`, missing `prisma generate`
- **Fix Required**: Update build script to `prisma generate && next build`
- **Prevention Gap**: No git hooks to catch build failures before deployment

### Key Learnings
- Prisma with custom output paths requires explicit generation in build scripts
- Vercel ignores package build scripts for security, breaking some postinstall patterns
- Need comprehensive git hooks to prevent deployment of broken builds
- Preview deployments caught this issue before production deployment
### Build Fixes (Critical)
- [x] Fix Prisma build script: update package.json build to include `prisma generate`
- [x] Test local build: verify `pnpm build` works with fixed script
### Execution Log
[22:57] Updated package.json build script from "next build" to "prisma generate && next build"
[22:58] Also updated build:analyze script for consistency
[22:59] Tested local build - successful completion in 6.0s
[22:59] Prisma Client generated to ./lib/generated/prisma in 116ms
[22:59] All 12 routes compiled successfully, no errors
- [x] Re-deploy to preview: deploy fixed version to Vercel preview
[23:00] Successful deployment in 2s - much faster incremental upload (84.3KB vs 957KB)
[23:00] New preview URL: https://scry-mi9ftuowc-moomooskycow.vercel.app
[23:00] Build completed successfully with fixed Prisma generation
- [ ] Test preview deployment: thoroughly test auth flow on preview URL

### Git Hooks Setup (Prevention)  
- [x] Install git hooks: add husky and lint-staged for automated quality checks
- [x] Configure pre-commit hooks: prisma generate, lint, type check on staged files
- [x] Configure pre-push hooks: full build verification before pushing
- [x] Test git hooks: verify hooks prevent bad commits and pushes

### Execution Log
[23:01] Installed husky@9.1.7 and lint-staged@16.1.2
[23:02] Initialized husky with `pnpm exec husky init`
[23:03] Added lint-staged configuration to package.json for TypeScript/JavaScript files
[23:04] Updated pre-commit hook to use `pnpm exec lint-staged`
[23:05] Created pre-push hook with full build verification and emoji feedback
[23:06] Fixed lint-staged configuration to use direct eslint instead of next lint
[23:07] Successfully tested both pre-commit and pre-push hooks
[23:07] Pre-commit: Runs eslint --fix and tsc --noEmit on staged files
[23:07] Pre-push: Runs full `pnpm build` with success/failure feedback

### Prevention Features Implemented
- **Pre-commit**: Lints and type-checks only staged files for speed
- **Pre-push**: Full build verification prevents broken code from reaching remote
- **Automatic fixes**: ESLint auto-fixes issues during pre-commit
- **Clear feedback**: Emoji-based success/failure messages  
- **Performance**: lint-staged only processes changed files
- **Robustness**: Automatic backup and restore of file states

### Final Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to production: run `vercel --prod` for production deployment
- [ ] Monitor deployment: run `vercel logs --prod --follow` to monitor real-time logs
- [ ] Set up alerts: configure Vercel monitoring alerts for errors
- [ ] Document deployment: update README with deployment instructions

### Environment & Configuration
- [ ] Consolidate .env files: reimagine and consolidate .env, .env.local, .env.example, and .env.local.example into proper hierarchy

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication: use shadcn InputOTP component for TOTP verification
- [ ] Create 2FA setup flow: use shadcn Dialog with QR code display and InputOTP for verification
- [ ] Implement password auth: add shadcn PasswordInput component (custom with show/hide toggle)
- [ ] Add password strength: use shadcn Progress component to show password strength meter
- [ ] Create admin dashboard: use shadcn DataTable for user management interface
- [ ] Add admin user actions: use shadcn DropdownMenu for user actions (suspend, delete, etc.)
- [ ] Implement email reminders: use shadcn Badge to show verification status
- [ ] Create recovery flow: use shadcn Stepper component (or custom steps) for account recovery
- [ ] Add login history: use shadcn Table with sorting for device/location history
- [ ] Create API key management: use shadcn Card components with copy button for API keys
- [ ] Set up Vercel Cron Jobs for session cleanup
