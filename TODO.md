## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

## SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS

### Rate Limiting Setup (BLOCKED - Manual KV Setup)
- [!] Set up Vercel KV: Create KV store via Vercel Dashboard (Storage tab)
**BLOCKED**: Manual task - KV stores must be created via Vercel Dashboard, not CLI

### Manual Steps Required:
1. Visit Vercel Dashboard â†’ Storage tab
2. Create new KV store named "scry-kv"
3. Run `vercel env pull .env.local` to get KV environment variables
4. Proceed with rate limiter implementation once KV store exists

### Rate Limiting Implementation (After KV Setup)
- [ ] Link KV to project: KV store should auto-link, run `vercel env pull` to get KV env vars
- [ ] Implement rate limiter: create `/lib/rate-limit.ts` using @vercel/kv for auth endpoint protection
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware: apply rate limiter to `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- [ ] Test rate limiting: verify rate limits work locally and in production
- [ ] Monitor security logs: use `vercel logs --prod` to monitor authentication attempts

### Additional Security Tasks
- [x] Enable HTTPS redirect: ensure `headers()` in next.config.js includes strict transport security
  **COMPLETED**: Already implemented with comprehensive HSTS + CSP upgrade-insecure-requests

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Caching & Performance
- [ ] Configure KV session cache: implement session caching in `/lib/auth.ts` using Vercel KV
- [ ] Set cache TTL: configure 5-minute cache TTL for session lookups in KV
- [x] Optimize bundle size: run `pnpm analyze` to check impact of auth dependencies
  **COMPLETED**: Auth dependencies well-optimized at ~75-90KB in vendor chunk (186KB total, under 200KB target)

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Testing
- [x] **Add Unit Tests for Auth Configuration**: Test NextAuth configuration independently
  **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test suite implemented with Vitest framework
  - **Coverage**: 73.39% auth.ts coverage with 18 test cases covering email provider, callbacks, session config, event handlers

  - **Alerts**: Automatic alerts via logging for slow operations, failures, and threshold breaches
  - **Features**: Health checks, trend analysis, slow operation detection, configurable thresholds
  - **UI**: Added performance monitoring tab to settings page with live charts and metrics

## CONFIGURATION & ENVIRONMENT
