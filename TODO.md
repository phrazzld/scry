# Scry UI/UX Quality of Life Improvements TODO

Generated from TASK.md on 2025-08-27

## Code Review Follow-ups (2025-08-29)

The following items synthesize the rigorous code review of the ui-ux-quality-improvements branch. They are grouped by priority and reference concrete files to change.

### Critical

- [x] Replace btoa-based token generation in Convex auth with Node-safe base64url ✅ FIXED 2025-08-29
  - Why: btoa is not available in Convex/Node runtimes and will throw
  - Files: convex/auth.ts
  - Action: Use Buffer.from(bytes).toString('base64') and convert to base64url (replace +/ and trim =)

- [x] Stop logging raw request headers in generate-quiz API ✅ FIXED 2025-08-29
  - Why: Avoid accidental logging of cookies/authorization; rely on structured serializers or pass a safe subset
  - Files: app/api/generate-quiz/route.ts
  - Action: Only log user-agent/content-type/accept or omit headers entirely

- [x] Improve client IP extraction for rate limiting ✅ FIXED 2025-08-29
  - Why: x-forwarded-for can contain multiple IPs; current fallback to 'unknown' degrades bucket quality
  - Files: app/api/generate-quiz/route.ts
  - Action: Use first IP from x-forwarded-for, fallback to x-real-ip or request.ip; trim/validate

### High

- [x] Resolve prompt sanitization whitelist vs replacement token mismatch ✅ FIXED 2025-08-29
  - Why: sanitizedTopicSchema forbids [ ] but sanitizeTopic inserts "[URL removed]"/"[email removed]"
  - Files: lib/prompt-sanitization.ts, lib/prompt-sanitization.test.ts
  - Action: Either add [] to allowed chars, or use parentheses tokens, or remove entirely; update tests accordingly

- [x] Combine filters correctly in getUserQuestions ✅ FIXED 2025-08-29
  - Why: Reassigning query for topic and onlyUnattempted overwrites earlier constraints
  - Files: convex/questions.ts
  - Action: Start from the most selective index (e.g., by_user_topic) and apply filter for attemptCount, or explicitly disallow combined filters

- [ ] Improve pagination in getQuizHistory
  - Why: Collecting all documents to compute total is O(n); will degrade with scale
  - Files: convex/quiz.ts
  - Action: Prefer cursor-based pagination by completedAt/_id; compute hasMore via one extra take; consider background counts if needed

- [x] Align topic length limits across app ✅ FIXED 2025-08-29
  - Why: Sanitization allows up to 200 chars; edit modal caps at 100, causing UX inconsistency
  - Files: lib/prompt-sanitization.ts, components/question-edit-modal.tsx, components/topic-input.tsx
  - Action: Pick a single max (100 or 200) and apply consistently (schemas, UI validation)

### Medium

- [ ] Schedule periodic cleanup of rate limit entries
  - Why: cleanupExpiredRateLimits exists but is not scheduled; table may grow unbounded
  - Files: convex/rateLimit.ts, Convex scheduler configuration
  - Action: Add a cron/scheduler job to run cleanup daily/hourly

- [ ] Replace console.log/console.error in Convex functions with structured logger
  - Why: Consistent production logging and redaction
  - Files: convex/auth.ts, convex/emailActions.ts, convex/migrations.ts (status logs)
  - Action: Use lib/logger.ts context loggers; guard noisy logs with NODE_ENV checks where appropriate

- [ ] Correct AI fallback logging to match returned question count
  - Why: Log mentions fallbackQuestionCount: 1, but two fallback questions are returned
  - Files: lib/ai-client.ts
  - Action: Update log metadata/message to reflect 2 fallback questions or adjust fallback set

- [ ] Add focused tests for edge cases
  - Why: Solidify guarantees around sanitization and rate-limit edges
  - Files: lib/prompt-sanitization.test.ts, new tests for rate limit window boundaries
  - Action: Add tests for bracket/parenthesis replacement, and boundary cases for retryAfter calculations

  - Critical issues:
    - `_handler` property access on Convex mutations/queries (internal API)
    - Mock database context type mismatches with GenericMutationCtx
    - Missing properties: auth, storage, scheduler, runQuery, runMutation
    - Implicit any types in test query functions
  - Implementation approach:
    - Research official Convex testing documentation and patterns
    - Replace `_handler` usage with proper testing utilities
    - Fix mock context to match full GenericMutationCtx interface
    - Add proper TypeScript types throughout test files
    - Consider using Convex's official testing utilities if available
