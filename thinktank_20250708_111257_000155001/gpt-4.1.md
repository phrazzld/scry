Here’s an expert analysis of your authentication flow failures based on the technical details and logs provided:

## 1. **Root Cause Analysis: 500 Error on `/email` Endpoint**

### Most Likely Primary Cause

**The 500 error when NextAuth tries to send a magic link email is most commonly due to a misconfiguration or failure in the SMTP/email provider layer—in your case, Resend.**

#### Key Evidence:
- **500 error on `/email` endpoint.**
- Your NextAuth `EmailProvider` config uses Resend for SMTP.
- Environment variables are set, but email sending still fails.
- Comprehensive error logging is enabled (lib/auth.ts).

#### Common Direct Causes:
- **EMAIL_FROM domain is not verified in Resend.** (Resend only allows sending from verified domains.)
- **RESEND_API_KEY is missing/invalid, or has a trailing newline.**
- **SMTP credentials (`EMAIL_SERVER_USER`, `EMAIL_SERVER_HOST`, `EMAIL_SERVER_PORT`) are incorrect or missing.**
- **Malformed environment variable values (e.g., newlines in secrets).**
- **Resend account is rate limited or suspended.**
- **Prisma adapter is misconfigured, but less likely if only `/email` fails.**

**In your context, the most likely direct cause is:**
- The `EMAIL_FROM` value is not a verified sender in Resend (e.g., using `noreply@scry.vercel.app` instead of a pre-verified Resend domain like `hello@resend.dev`).

**This is consistent with what you’d see if you attempt to send from an unverified domain: Resend will reject the request, NextAuth fails to send, and you get a 500 error on the `/email` endpoint.**

## 2. **Error Cascading: Relationships Between the Three Errors**

- **CSP Font Violations:**  
  - `"font-src 'self' data:"` blocks loading from Google Fonts (`fonts.gstatic.com`).  
  - This breaks font loading but does *not* directly cause auth failures.  
  - However, it can clutter the console and obscure real errors.

- **Email API 500 Error:**  
  - The `/api/auth/email` endpoint is invoked by NextAuth when sending a magic link.
  - If the email fails to send (e.g., due to invalid sender), NextAuth returns a 500 error with a generic message, and the client receives an empty or malformed response.

- **JSON Parse Error on Client:**  
  - The client expects a JSON response, but the server returns either an empty response or an HTML error page (due to 500 error).
  - So, `response.json()` fails with `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input`.
  - This is a direct consequence of the `/email` 500 error, not a separate bug.

### **Summary of Cascade**
- Email misconfiguration ⇒ 500 error on `/email` ⇒ malformed/empty response ⇒ client JSON parse error.
