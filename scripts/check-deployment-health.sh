# Deployment Health Check Script
# Validates that Convex backend functions are deployed and accessible
# Also validates that all required environment variables are present
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-deployment-health.sh
#
# Notes:
#   - Checks the Convex deployment configured in .convex/config (dev or prod)
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL env var is validated but deployment check uses .convex/config
#   - To check production: Ensure you've run `npx convex deploy` to set prod config
#   - To check dev: Ensure you've run `npx convex dev` to set dev config
#
# Exit codes: 0 = healthy, 1 = unhealthy
